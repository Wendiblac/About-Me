            <p>
                Hi there! welcome to my profile, My name is Wendy Amadi but I love to go by Wendiblac, and I am excited to be part of the Altschool Engineering Program.
                I joined this program due to my passion for technology and my desire to gain practical skills.
                My fascination with technology and its ability to solve complex problems has always driven me to explore new opportunities in the field.
                I began my journey with self-taught programming in languages in like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which gave me a strong foundation in software development.
                Over time, I realized that software engineering goes beyond just coding, it's about creating solutions that enhance effiency, accessibility, and user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                My experience spans various industries, including e-commerce, Customer support and technology startups, where I've gained insights into the challenges businesses face
                in implementing effective digital solutions. This exposure has fueled my passion for building impactful software that bridges gaps and creates new opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond academics, I value collaboration and innovation, and I believe that teamwork is essential for tackling the challenges of today's digital landscape.
                I am committed to using my skills to contribute to meaningful projects that make a difference.
